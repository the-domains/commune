EXT. GRASSY AREA - MORNING

A MAN is on his knees. Eyes closed. Arms stretched towards the sky. 
He is smeared with dirt. He sports unkempt hair with three days worth of
salt and pepper stubble on his chin. He appears to be in his 50's. He 
is naked. His body jerks, stiffens and twitches haphazardly. He talks to
himself, almost chanting, in an unfamiliar language.
